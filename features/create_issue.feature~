Feature: Creating an Issue

	As a user,
	So that I can discuss topics that are important to me and others,
	I want to be able to create a new issue.

Scenario:
	Given that I have a user account
	And that I am on the new issue page
	When I fill in "Title" with "Alpha"
	And I fill in "Description" with "Bravo"
	And I fill in "Goal" with "Charlie"
	And I press "Create Issue"
	Then I should see my new issue
